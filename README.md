# Infrastructure Documentation

What is the Use of Infrastructure Document?

Infrastructure documents play an important role in illustrating about Peerplays nodes and the process of working on a node. There are various categories to describe about the concepts of Peerplays and they are listed below.&#x20;

## The Basics

The concepts under the basics describes the Node type, Hardware requirement, CLI wallet, and First Tokens. This section focus on providing the essential details about the requirement before starting the process using Node. Click the below link to learn more about the basic concepts.

## Advanced Topics

The topics under this section explain about the Test environment, steps involved in manual installation, enabling Elasticsearch in node. To know about the concepts in details click the below link.

## Witnesses

The Peerplays Witnesses will bundle transactions into blocks and sign them with their signing key. Witnesses keep the blockchain alive by producing one block every three seconds. For example, if there are 20 Witnesses, each would produce one block every minute. To learn more about the witness [click here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-LssGFn6gx89DxPYsP95/witnesses).&#x20;

There are various types of procedure like Manual, Docker, GitLab Artifact installation for Witness node. Click the below link to know more about the steps involved in installation. &#x20;

## Sidechain Operator Nodes (SONs)

_Sidechain Operator Nodes_ - SONs facilitate the transfer of off-chain assets (like Bitcoin, Hive, or Ethereum tokens) between the Peerplays chain and the asset's native chain. These nodes often run the Peerplays node software and node software of other chains. To know more about the SONs [click here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-LssGFn6gx89DxPYsP95/technology/sidechain-operator-nodes-sons).

Click the below link to explore about the installation guides to operate SONs.

## Bookie Oracle Suite (BOS)

The Bookie Oracle System, or BOS, is a unique decentralized sports feed oracle system originally designed for the BookiePro dApp. Click below link to learn more about the BOS.

The below section explains about the BOS Installation using MongoDB, Redis, configuration of bos-auto. Along with the detailed explanation on how to Install BookieSports & MINT.

## Data Proxies

The Data Proxy serves as a middle man between the Data Feed Providers (DFPs) and the Bookie Oracle System (BOS) operated by the Witnesses.&#x20;

Data proxy is the process through which the all the data received by BOS is normalized/parsed to the required format.

Click the below section to learn in details about:

1. Data proxy Introduction
2. How Data proxy works?
3. How to set up Data Proxy?
4. How to create own Data Proxy?

## Couch Potato

BookiePro requires real-time data feeds in order to create various sports, events, markets etc. that are the basis of the sporting exchange which fabricate a challenge whether data is reliable and accurate. This leads to the introduction of couch potato concept where a person input data directly into a portal/API which gets posted directly to BOS. The person here is the "data feed provider" and API/Portal is the "Data Proxy".

Click the below section to learn in detail about Couch Potato:

1. Introduction
2. Functional Requirement
3. User guide to create an account
4. Use of Database and API &#x20;
5. Proxy payment consideration
