# Obtaining Your First Tokens

**What is PPY token?**

PPY (Peerplays coin) is the native asset of Peerplays network. All exchanges in Peerplays Dex are based on exchanging assets with PPY. PPY is the main store of value in Peerplays and used to pay transaction fees on network.

{% hint style="info" %}
Setting up a Witness node requires about 15 PPY. This is to pay for an upgraded account (5 PPY) and to create a new witness (8 PPY). The remaining funds are to pay for various transaction fees while setting up the node (like voting for yourself!).

&#x20;Note that these fees will likely change over time as recommended by the Committee of Advisors.
